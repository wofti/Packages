I modified all makefiles to make it run on my Debian system with gcc and
icc. In the main Makefile we probably want to set

CC = icc
CFLAGS = -O3

and maybe also
CC_F2CLIBS = icc
CFLAGS_F2CLIBS = -O2 -DNON_UNIX_STDIO

I also changed GMRES.c BiCGSTAB.c and CGS.c so that they no longer use
static local vars. I want to make them thread safe.

Then I changed GMRES.c so that when it exits because the number of
iterations are exceeded, it exits in the same way as if the tolerance goal
was reached (just the return value is different). Before it exited
differently which always seemed to cause NANs. The original version is in
GMRES_orig.c
