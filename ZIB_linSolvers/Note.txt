Numerical Mathematics- NewtonLib

Software repository for Peter Deuflhards Book "Newton Methods for Nonlinear
Problems -- Affine Invariance and Adaptive Algorithms"

This monograph presents a scheme to construct adaptive Newton-type
algorithms in close connection with an associated affine invariant
convergence analysis. Part of these algorithms are presented as informal
programs in the text. Some, but not all of the described algorithms have
been worked out in detail. Below follows a list of codes mentioned by name
in the book.

All of the available programs (not only by the author and his group) are
free as long as they are exclusively used for research or teaching purposes.
For commercial use of the software you must sign a license-agreement with
the ZIB and pay a license-charge that depends on the referenced software
package and the intended usage. Please read our sample license agreement for
more details. If you have signed a license agreement for commercial use,
then you may download the complete NewtonLib as one compressed tar-file
here.

An asterisks * indicate that a code is still under development at the time
of the appearance of the book in print.
