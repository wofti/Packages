Some packages:
--------------
ZIB_linSolvers:
contains some linear solvers that seem to work, but are not as good as the
ones in dctemplates.

lis-1.3.11:
Another linear solver library. I tested version 1.3.11 with sgrid. It also
wasn't better than dctemplates. However, there are newer versions now...


Valuable packages:
------------------
UMFPACK:
it needs AMD and UFconfig. The AMD, UFconfig, and UMFPACK directories
must all reside in the same parent directory. Nowadays it should suffice to
just install libsuitesparse from UFL (which is also in Debian). This has all
we need.

dctemplates:
I modified this to use it with sgrid. It contains linear solvers
like: BiCGstab, GMRES, ...
The orignal is in dctemplates_orig. Later I further modified it to use
external BLAS and LAPACK, since the version included in dctemplatesis very
old and primitive. This is in dctemplates_extBlasLapack.

dctemplates_extBlasLapack:
This is what we likely want to use. It contains linear solvers
like: BiCGstab, GMRES, ...
It needs to be linked together with at least BLAS, probably we want to use
whichever BLAS is best for our system.
