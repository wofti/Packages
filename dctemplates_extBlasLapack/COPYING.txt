Dear Dr. Dongarra,

I am not sure if you are the correct person to write to, but I have a
question regarding the templates software at http://www.netlib.org/templates
and your name appears on the bottom of many web pages there.

We have written a program (called sgrid) that solves elliptic equations to
find binary neutron star initial data in General Relativity. In it we use a
modified version of GMRES from templates. It all works quite well. However,
we now would like to make our program publicly available under the GPL
license. Would it be ok with you and your co-authors if we distribute the
modified templates library along with our program? On netlib.org it says all
the software there is free, but I am not entirely sure what we are allowed
to do, as there is no real license or rules inside templates.

Thank you very much,
Wolfgang

The short answer is yes. The templates software carries a Modified BSD license.
