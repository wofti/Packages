Compiling:
----------
I modified all makefiles to get it to run on my Debian system with gcc and
icc. In the main Makefile we probably want to set

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -O3

and maybe also
CC_F2CLIBS = gcc
CFLAGS_F2CLIBS = -O2 -DNON_UNIX_STDIO

After this, we can compile by simply typing:
make

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
History:
--------
It seems the original programs from Richard Barrett et al. had some
drawbacks that made them unsuitable for our purposes. So:

I changed GMRES.c, BiCGSTAB.c, CGS.c, BiCG.c and QMR.c so that they no
longer use static local vars. I want to make them thread safe.

Then I changed GMRES.c so that when it exits because the number of
iterations are exceeded, it exits in the same way as if the tolerance goal
was reached (just the return value is different). Before it exited
differently which always seemed to cause NANs. The original version is in
GMRES_orig.c

I also commented out the first tol comparison in GMRES so that it always
does something:
* before this change GMRES would immediately exit with success
  if (norm2 / bnrm2 < tol)
* variables set before this now commented out line:
  +norm2 is norm of M^-1 (b - Ax), where M^-1 is precon solve
  +bnrm2 is norm of b
Without this change GMRES might have exited immediately reporting success,
but without setting the solution vector at all.

Then I changed the Makefile such that we no longer compile
dlapack.c and dblas.c
So now we have to link against whatever LAPACK and BLAS libraries we have.
In doing so I discovered that MatGen.c needs dlaran_ which is a primitive
random number generator, whose code is in dlapack.c. I add the file 
templates_dlaran.c which now contains templates_dlaran_ and edited
MatGen.c to use it.

I also changed the Makefile so that the test is no longer in
libiteratortemplates.a 
For this reason I had to move the function getbreak_() out of Tester.c into
the separate file WT_utils.c

BUT note: getbreak_ calls dlamch_ which is in LAPACK. For this reason we
still need to link the whole thing with LAPACK!

I changed MatVec.c, PSolve.c, Tester.c, Utils.c, dnsychk.c, dspdchk.c
so that the common blocks have now extern for the structs system_, matdim_
and forms_ . This way we can compile without -fcommon on the new gcc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLAS and LAPACK:
----------------
with:
make libdl_lapack_blas.a
we can make  libdlblas.a , libdllapack.a and libdl_lapack_blas.a
which contain double and long int versions of BLAS, LAPACK and both
LAPACK+BLAS. They are built from dlapack.c and dblas.c .
